# How It Works
Simple Microsite Builder offers an easy solution for anyone who wants to build a tiny website without much time and effort.

Just fill in the form with your own words and we will publish it to the web for you. If you have an image file you want to use, upload it in any public server you like and put the reference URL in the box. You can also embed Google Map, Youtube video, Twitter feed and other code snippets from third-parties.

You can update your microsite after publishing by accessing the Editor URL provided at the time of site creation. All the information you entered in the form is stored in a Jig. Your microsite's design template is also tied to a Jig.

# Technical Note
Currently using Test-net tokens. If the app did not work because of low funds, we appreciate your test-net coin donation to the following address.

The current version uses our Owner Private Key to issue/update Jigs. The user does not own the NFT with their site data, but enjoys the benefit of not having to manage the keys. The site is not fully secure since anyone who knows the Editor URL can make changes. However, we believe that the 10 cents editing fee will deter such malicious acts.

# Possibilities
Providing Owner Private Keys to users - Let users "own" their site data

Social Media Button Widget - Link to user's HandCashMe, BitPost, Relica Accounts

Branded Domain Short Links - Provide branded short links to the microsite

Design Template Market - Let UI designers create and sell CSS NFTs
